# Guidance
The summary and guidance of this team project.
## Workflow
### Source Code
There are three parts of work which need coding. I create separate repositories for each one of them. 

For people who are responsible for that, update your code in that repository. Write a README about how to read and use your code, if you don’t have enough annotations. 
### Schedule 
I set this part into the project tab. 

In the schedule project, I split the estimated tasks of each period. Everyone can see your jobs in the coming time. After you finish one task, move it to the ‘Done’ column.

Basically, if we do this project well, when we finish them, every task should be under the ‘Done’ column.
